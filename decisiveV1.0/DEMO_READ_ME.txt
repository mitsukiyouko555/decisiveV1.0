In case Paul King/CTS Engineers want to see the actual code I wrote...

Here is a note for the engineers.

Decisive.V1.0 is working - though cannot save ie has no persistence once you exit the program. 2.0 was to make it save but I stopped working on it a while ago and can't remember whether it works or not but V1.0 works for sure...

For the OOFileSystem, that is still a WIP.. about half the functions are there...85 as shown in the OOFile System Checklist.

Note that in the demo video.. I have the OOFileSystem working but I HEAVILY reference paths that only exist in my laptop.. if one were to try to run it it wouldn't work unless all references of the paths were adjusted. (As engineers you could probs tell that just by looking at the code.. but figured I'd give you a heads up just in case lol.)

Dunno if you'll even read this :3 but in case u do here it is...

One thing I forgot to demo in the video was the deletion of a folder. Yes it can delete a folder but only if it is empty. I have not had the time to research how to make it delete all the stuff within the folder.

In Summary, my coding skills include:

- Basic HTML

- Basic CSS

- Basic Javascript

- Basic Perl

- Basic Linux Skills (having dabbled in ethical hacking a little and used Kali Linux and at one point booted Kali Linux on USB with persistence though now I use VM's.)
